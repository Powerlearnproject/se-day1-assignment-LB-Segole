Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software engeneering is the testing, developing and maintaining of software in a structured way using code. It is important because it ensures that software is always high-quality, it saves time and prevents errors in time and it assists the software in growing with the business need through continious updates and modifications.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

1968 – The Term "Software Engineering"
First used to address software problems.
1980s – Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
Made coding more reusable and efficient.
2000s – Agile and DevOps
Introduced faster and more flexible ways to develop software.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

Planning - Defining the project scope, goals, timeline, budget, and resource allocation. 
Requirements Analysis - Gathering detailed specifications and functionalities needed from the software, including user needs and system constraints. 
Design - Creating the software architecture, system flow diagrams, and user interface design. 
Development (Coding) - Writing the actual code based on the design specifications. 
Testing - Executing test cases to identify and fix bugs, ensuring quality and functionality.
Deployment - Distributing the software to the intended users, including installation and configuration. 
Maintenance - Addressing issues that arise after deployment, including bug fixes, updates, and enhancements. 

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
In terms of the approach, Waterfall tends to be linear and sequential while Agile is more iterative and flexible. Because of how linear Waterfall is, it proves difficult to make changes and Agile is easier to adapt to changes. Then the delivery method to Waterfall is only delivered at the end while Agile is delivered in incremets. Scenarios in which Waterfall is used is in large case and stable projects like government software and bank software. Agile is used in dynamic and evolving projects such as startups and mobile applications 


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Software Developer: Writes, tests, and maintains code
Quality Assurance Engineer: Ensures software quality through testing
Project Manager: Oversees project progress, schedules, and team coordination


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

IDEs: Enhance productivity with tools like code completion, debugging, and testing. (Examples: Visual Studio Code and PyCharm)
VCS: Track code changes and enable collaboration. (Examples: Git, GitHub, GitLab)


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

Bugs in Code – Use debugging tools and systematic testing.
Changing Requirements – Use Agile to adapt.
Tight Deadlines – Prioritize important tasks.
Security Issues – Follow secure coding practices.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

Unit Testing: Tests individual components for functionality
Integration Testing: Ensures different modules work together.
System Testing: Verifies the entire system meets requirements.
Acceptance Testing: Confirms software is ready for end users.
#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt engineering is the skill of writing clear instructions for AI to get better results. It helps AI understand what users want and respond accurately.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Example of a Vague vs. Clear Prompt
Vague Prompt: "Tell me about technology."
Clear Prompt: "Explain how AI is used in healthcare, with examples."
It focuses on AI in healthcare instead of a broad topic and asks for examples, making the answer more useful and consise.
